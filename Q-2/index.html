                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>In 2025, technology and gadgets are more intelligent, connected, and sustainable than ever before.
                    Smartphones continue to evolve with foldable and rollable displays, AI-enhanced cameras, and
                    satellite connectivity, offering users greater flexibility and safety. Wearable technology has also
                    advanced significantly, with smartwatches and rings now capable of monitoring health metrics such as
                    blood pressure, stress levels, and even hydration in real time. Smart home devices have become more
                    intuitive, integrating generative AI into voice assistants for natural conversations and enhanced
                    control over lighting, appliances, and home security systems. In the realm of augmented and virtual
                    reality, lightweight AR glasses and powerful mixed-reality headsets like the Apple Vision Pro are
                    transforming how users interact with digital content, from entertainment to professional tasks.</p>
